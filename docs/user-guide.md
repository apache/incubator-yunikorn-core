# User Guide

Before reading this guide, we assume you either have a Kubernetes cluster, or a local Kubernetes dev environment, e.g MiniKube.
It is also assumed that `kubectl` is on your path and properly configured.
Follow this [guide](setup/env-setup.md) on how to setup a local Kubernetes cluster using docker-desktop.

All files mentioned in this user guide are part of the [yunikorn-k8shim](https://github.com/cloudera/yunikorn-k8shim) repository.
They are located in the `deployments` sub directory. The command given assume that you are located in that directory.

## Setup
The first step is to create the RBAC role for the scheduler
```
kubectl create -f scheduler/yunikorn-rbac.yaml
```
The role is a requirement on the current versions of kubernetes.

## Deploy the scheduler on k8s
Before you can deploy the scheduler the image for the scheduler and the web interface must be build with the appropriate tags.
The procedure on hwo to build the images is explained in the [build document](./developer-guide.md).
```
kubectl create -f scheduler/scheduler.yaml
```
The deployment will run 2 containers from your pre-built docker images in 1 pod,

* yunikorn-scheduler-core (yunikorn scheduler core and shim for K8s)
* yunikorn-scheduler-web (web UI)

The pod is deployed as a customized scheduler, it will take the responsibility to schedule pods which explicitly specifies `schedulerName: yunikorn` in pod's spec.

## Access to the web UI
When the scheduler is deployed, the web UI is also deployed in a container.
Port forwarding for the web interface on the standard ports can be turned on via:
```
// UI port
kubectl port-forward yunikorn-scheduler 9889

// web service port
kubectl port-forward yunikorn-scheduler 9080
```

## Run workloads with YuniKorn Scheduler

Unlike default Kubernetes scheduler, YuniKorn has `application` notion in order to support batch workloads better.
There are a few ways to run batch workloads with YuniKorn scheduler

- Add labels `applicationId` and `queue` in pod's spec.
- Pods that have the same applicationId will be considered as tasks from 1 application.

Here is an example of the entry to add:
```yaml
  labels:
    applicationId: "MyOwnApplicationId"
    queue: "root.sandbox"
```   
All examples provided in the next section have the labels already set. The `queue` name must be a known queue name from the configuration.
Unknown queue names will cause the pod to be rejected by the YuniKorn scheduler.  

### Running simple sample applications

All sample deployments can be found under `examples` directory.
The list of all examples is in the [README](https://github.com/cloudera/yunikorn-k8shim/blob/master/deployments/examples).
Not all examples are given here

A single pod: 
```
// some nginx pods
kubectl create -f examples/nigix/nginx.yaml
```
A simple sleep job:
```
// some pods simply run sleep
kubectl create -f examples/sleep/sleeppods.xml
```

### Running a spark application
Kubernetes support for Apache Spark is not part of all releases. You must have a current release of Apache Spark with Kubernetes support built in. 

The `examples/spark` directory contains pod template files for the Apache Spark driver and executor, they can be used if you want to run Spark on K8s using this scheduler.

* Get latest spark from github (only latest code supports to specify pod template), URL: https://github.com/apache/spark
* Build spark with Kubernetes support:
```
./build/mvn -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.7 -Dhadoop.version=2.7.0 -Phive -Pkubernetes -Phive-thriftserver -DskipTests package
```
* Run spark submit
```
spark-submit --master k8s://http://localhost:8001 --deploy-mode cluster --name spark-pi \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
  --conf spark.executor.instances=1 \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=yunikorn/spark:latest \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.driver.podTemplateFile=examples/spark/driver.yaml \
  --conf spark.kubernetes.executor.podTemplateFile=examples/spark/executor.yaml \
  local:///opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Spark uses its own version of the application ID tag called *spark-app-id*. This tags is required for the pods to be recognised as specific spark pods.  
* examples/spark/driver.yaml
* examples/spark/executor.yaml
When you run Spark on Kubernetes with pod templates, *spark-app-id* is considered the applicationId.   

### Affinity scheduling
The scheduler supports affinity and ati affinity scheduling on kubernetes using predicates:
```
kubectl create -f examples/predicates/pod-anti-affinity-example.yaml
```
This deployment ensures 2 pods cannot be co-located together on same node.
If this yaml is deployed on 1 node cluster, expect 1 pod to be started and the other pod should stay in a pending state.

### A volume example
There are two examples with volumes available. The NFS example does not work on docker desktop and requires [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

CAUTION: Both examples will generate an unending stream of data in a file called `dates.txt` on the mounted volume. This could cause a disk to fill up and execution time should be limited. 
* create the local volume and volume claim
```
kubectl create -f examples/volume/local-pv.yaml
```
* create the pod that uses the volume
```
kubectl create -f examples/volume/pod-local.yaml
```
